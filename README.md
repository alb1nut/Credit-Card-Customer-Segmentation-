# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project segments approximately 9,000 credit card customers using **K-Means clustering** based on behavioral patterns such as purchases, payments, and cash advances. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to support **data-driven marketing**, personalize offers, and improve engagement.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 18 behavioral variables for each customer, including:
- Balances and credit limits
- Purchase amounts and frequencies
- Cash advances and transactions
- Payments and minimum payments
- Tenure of the credit card

## Objective
- Identify distinct customer segments
- Understand high-value and low-value customers
- Enable targeted marketing and personalized offers

## Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, scale numerical variables  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns  
3. **Clustering Analysis:** Apply K-Means to segment customers  
4. **Cluster Profiling:** Analyze characteristics of each cluster  
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** Suggest marketing strategies for each segment  

## Technologies Used
